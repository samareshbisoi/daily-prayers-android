        <p align="justify">In my Church, we actually shared this book with all our English Department Cell Leaders (around 30 of them) for them to bless their members. Will be great to receiveother language versions as we have Tamil, Mandarin, Bahasa and Vietnamese congregation. This special book answer some of my questions, gave me clarity in many areas and I pray the prayers from this book regularly.<br><br>

This book will also help those who have not yet accepted our Lord but have heard the Gospel. My next step is to share with those friends/family who heard the Gospel but have not made a decision. I will be emailing to my family doctor. I shared this book with many friends from other churches and they are blessed.</p>

        <p align="justify">I am a Christian more than 10 years and as time went on spiritualizing my relationship with God. I did not realize that occupied much of my time doing things to get close to him , and that only distanced us more.<br><br>

When I started reading the book God loves you , it was like reconnect with my first love and my relationship with God became simple, I did not need to do a lot to get close to him , only had to look forward to in the privacy of my room , so simple as that!.<br><br>

I feel more empowered , strengthened and encouraged to preach the gospel Thanks for giving us such a sincere material that helps us in a world of complicated Christians.</p>

        <p align="justify">‚ÄúSleep is one of my small luxuries after a busy day at the hospital, mom duties and coping w/life‚Äôs unexpected curveballs. Imagine almost a month of dreams being alone in your home feeling lost and suddenly finding yourself pushing against the front door as something dark fights to get through ‚Ä¶<br><br>

I kept going to church, trying to pray about it, knowing instinctively these dreams were something more. But I felt so empty‚Ä¶ I had no words, no feelings. Nothing.<br><br>

Then one busy morning, my friend Dr Jasmin passes by my room. It was a surprise because we don‚Äôt have the same work schedule. She asked me how I was, and I told her about the dreams ‚Ä¶ and how empty I was, feeling so far from Him.<br><br>

Dr. Jasmin hugged me tightly, prayed over me and with me‚Ä¶ then she got my cell to download a prayer app that she said will help me. It was ‚ÄúGod Loves You‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and she showed me how to use it.<br><br>

That night, I opened the app and read through ‚ÄúPutting on the Armour of God.‚Äù That was the first I slept through the night. I slept so soundly I had missed various messages, texts and an overseas call!<br><br>

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks, and I haven‚Äôt had any nightmares since then. My daughter and I, we use the app daily ‚Ä¶ in-between patients, while in the cab caught in traffic I read through all the prayers and scripture references attached. I now have a sense of calmness as I go through the days, and I know that while I sleep, I rest in Him who said ‚ÄúI have written your name on the palms of My hand.‚Äù (Isaiah 49:16)</p>

I really liked to do the translations , as I like to do my favorites things , like singing , practice my english , study and play guitar . This experience was amazing , and I loved to learn more about God reading the prayers .</p>
