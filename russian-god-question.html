          <h4>Questions People Frequently Ask</h4>
          

          <ul>
          <li>Before we begin, let us ask ourselves these questions….</li>
<li>Who is God for me?</li>
<li>What is my relationship with God? Does God punish?</li>
<li>According to me, is God a loving God or an angry God? How do I know if what I know is the Truth?</li>
<li><b>Who is God?</b><br><br>
God is Almighty. He is our Creator. We are His creations. He allows us to call Him as our Father through His Son,
Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><b>Who is Jesus?</b><br><br>
Jesus is the Son of God. God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He created everything and is the owner of
all creation.<br><br>
God sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to earth to die for us on the cross as a sacrifice so that we human
beings are saved from sin and are united to God as His children. <br><br>Jesus bore all our sins on the cross in order to save
us. Through Jesus Christ, we have the right to call God, our Creator as our Father (Abba).</li>
<li><b>Who is the Holy Spirit?</b><br><br>
When Jesus left this earth, He gave us His Spirit to dwell in us and guide us. This is the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li><b>Is Jesus God? Is the Holy Spirit God?</b><br><br>
Yes. We have a triune God. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are One. God created the heavens, the earth,
everything on earth and human beings. <br><br>He sent His Son,<br>
Jesus to come and dwell on earth. Jesus came to teach us Godly way of living and He came to die for us on the cross.<br><br>
He washed away our sins in His precious blood by dying for us on the cross so that we are united to God. And He has
given us His Holy Spirit to dwell in our hearts and be with us forever.<br><br>The Holy Spirit will reside in us if we invite Him to our hearts.</li>
<li><b>Who is God for me?</b><br><br>
God is our Loving Heavenly Father. We often look up to God as our Creator and we as His creations. But there is
more to this truth.<br><br>He is our Father and we are His children through our Lord Jesus Christ. When we believe in Jesus
as His begotten Son, we are united to God as His children. Through Jesus, we are entitled to call our Creator as Abba
Father.</li>
<li><b>What does God want from us?</b><br><br>
God wants us to know that He loves us. And He looks forward to us loving Him as our Father. <br><br>He wants us to know
that He has great plans for each one of us. He wants us to love Him, come closer to Him and strengthen
our relationship with Him.<br><br>He wants us to spend time with Him – talking to Him, seeking His guidance, in prayer,
in solitude. He wants us to know Him more closely.</li>
<li><b>What is the purpose of our lives?</b><br><br>
The purpose of our lives is to do God’s Will. And God’s
Will for us is to love Him, to know Him better and to know that He loves us beyond what we can imagine or what we
can describe in words. <br><br>In order to know how we can love Him, serve Him, serve others and be successful in our lives,
we need to spend more time with God, in His Holy Presence.</li>
<li><b>How can we come closer to God?</b><br><br>
We can come closer to God by regularly spending time in His Holy Presence, by reading and meditating on the Word
of God (the Bible), by praying to Him and by giving Him the first place in our lives. <br><br>Making time for Him and spending
time in His Presence every day should be our top priority.</li>
<li><b>What is solitude? What is ‘silent time’?</b><br><br>
Solitude is spending time with God, in His Holy Presence, at His Feet. God loves us and desires that we spend time
with Him and know His love for us. Often, we reach out to God and pray to Him only in times of our needs. <br><br>God
desires more from us. He desires that we spend time with Him not only when we need favors from Him but also
when everything is going good in our lives. He wants to be the most important person in our lives. <br><br>He wants us to
share with Him not just our sorrows, but our joy and happiness too. He wants us to discuss with Him our problems,
challenges, our joy, our success and everything that is part of our lives. <br><br>He wants us to surrender our lives and our
complete being to Him so that He can direct us with all the goodness and riches that He has in store for us.
And for that, we are to seek Him, spend time with Him, know Him and be obedient to Him.</li>
<li><b>What is God’s plan for us? What is salvation?</b><br><br>
It is God’s desire for everyone to have eternal life with
Him. Human beings rebelled against God and fell into sin. But God is so loving that He did not leave us without hope
or without solution. <br><br>God sent His Son, Jesus to this world to die for us on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins.<br><br>
When we believe in Jesus and repent, He forgives us and we are united to Him.
When we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior by personal faith, by trusting in the person of Jesus Christ, His sacrificial
death on the cross for our sins and His resurrection, we fulfil God’s desire for us to be saved from eternal judgment
and consequences of sin. <br><br>And we can be assured about our future with God, in His Holy Presence forever. And that
is salvation.</li>
<li><b>Does God really invite us to His Presence?</b><br><br>
It is God’s desire that we dwell in His Holy Presence.
When the first disciples of Jesus approached Jesus and asked Him where He lived, He answered, “Come and see.”<br><br>
And since then, the disciples followed Jesus and lived with Him. God’s love is the same – yesterday, today and
forever. Even now, if we are curious to know Him more, it is His invitation that we spend time with Him, know Him
and experience His love. <br><br>We only need to have a willing heart and a willing mind.
Jesus invites us and says, <font color="Blue"><i>“Come to Me, all who are tired from carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest.”</i></font><br><br>
Another wonderful promise of God for us, as mentioned in the Bible is, <font color="Blue"><i>“Cast all your anxiety on Him because He
cares for you.”</i></font>
Truly, God is a Loving God and He invites us to His Presence, to be with Him.</li>
<li><b>Why is Jesus worshipped?</b><br><br>
We worship Jesus because He is the Son of God. He came to earth to die for us. He came to earth to be with us and
to teach us Godly way of living.<br><br>He came to save us from the wrath of sin and sickness. <br><br>He died for us on the cross
and united us to God, our Loving Heavenly Father.
Through Him, we can call Almighty God as our Father.</li>
<li><b>Are there any specific prayer timings for praying to Jesus?</b><br><br>
No, there are no specific prayer timings or specific days of the week for praying to Jesus. God wants us to spend time
with Him every single day. We can pray to Him at any time of the day.
It is a good practice to pray to Jesus in the morning before we begin our day and also at night before we go to bed.<br><br>
We can pray for His blessings when we begin our day. At night, we can end our day in prayer thanking Him for His
grace and blessings. <br><br>The end of the day is also a good time to reflect upon the whole day, to thank Him for His
blessings, to ask Him for forgiveness for the mistakes that we would have done during the day and to seek His
guidance and blessings for the next day.<br><br>
We are also to pray for our dear ones, our friends, our neighbors and others. God loves it when we pray for
others. Therefore, we should also spend some time praying and interceding for other people.</li>
<li><b>Can someone go to church even during periods?</b><br><br>
Yes, one can go to church even during periods. There is no rule or restriction regarding this. Jesus is equally
accessible to the sick and to the healthy, the rich and the poor, the children and the adults. <br><br>Jesus came to earth to
dwell amongst us. He, being the Son of God had a choice where He wanted to be born. Instead of the comfort of a
rich house, He chose the manger as His place of birth. <br><br>He allowed the shepherds to visit Him first before other rich
people could visit Him.</li>
<li><b>How should we pray?</b><br><br>
There are no specific rules and regulations for praying. We can pray with our hands folded or our hands open. We
can pray while kneeling down, or sitting, or standing. What matters is our hearts. Jesus looks at our hearts.<br><br>
When we pray, we should thank and praise Him for all that He does for us and our dear ones. We can use specific
prayers as part of our daily prayer life. Prayer is also a time to openly talk to God, our Father. <br><br>When we talk to our
earthly father, we do not prepare beforehand on how we will talk and what words we will use. It is
spontaneous. <br><br>Likewise, when we reach out to our Loving Heavenly Father, our prayers can also be spontaneous in
nature. We need not prepare our words and sentences beforehand.
It is also a good practice to claim the promises of God (from the Bible) when we pray to God. When we pray, it is
good to pray and intercede for others also. <br><br>It warms
God’s heart when we pray for others.</li>
<li><b>Are there any specific days in a week for prayer?</b><br><br>
No, there are no specific days for prayers. Every day is special. And we are to pray every day to God. Churches
have special service every Sunday which we should attend for worshipping God as a community.
You can decide on specific days in a week for special prayers and for fasting. <br><br>You can decide a specific day for a
prayer group to get together and pray for each other’s prayer needs.</li>
<li><b>Are there any specific verses that we need to recite while praying? And when?</b><br><br>
You may or may not use specific verses while praying. Our Loving Jesus knows and understands what is in our hearts
and minds. <br><br>However, it is a good practice to use Bible promises and claim those promises when we pray to Him.
The Bible is The Truth. <br><br>The promises in the Bible are all available for us, for us to believe in and claim as ours.
There is no specific timing for prayers. <br><br>We can reach out to God whenever we want to. He is accessible and
available for us any time. He loves us more than we can ever imagine or describe.</li>
<li><b>What are the different kinds of prayers?</b><br><br>
There are different kinds of prayers for our every need. We can pray to God using the prayers that are readily
available to us. <br><br>These are ‘structured prayers’ (please refer to Section III of this book for prayers that you can use
while praying). <br><br>We can also pray to God in our own words and our own sentences. God understands even when we
do not have words to express our thoughts and feelings. <br><br>He is our Loving God.
God wants us to pray and intercede for other people. When we pray to God, we should also pray for others who
might be in similar situations as us (even when we might not know them). <br><br>That way, we become a blessing in other
people’s lives. And God is delighted.</li>
<li><b>At times I am anxious and unable to concentrate in prayers. What should I do?</b><br><br>
During moments of anxiety and depression, remember the moments in the past when God has blessed you.<br><br>
Thank Him for all the blessings that He has showered upon your life. Praise Him for who He is – our God and our
Loving Father. <br><br>Bring to mind how He blesses His people. Remember the stories from the Bible of how He blessed His
people (for example: bringing them out of Egypt, making a way in the Red Sea, being with them as they travelled
through the desert, guiding them from a pillar of fire and a pillar of cloud, providing them with food and water in the
desert, etc.). <br><br>Thank and praise God all the more. And as you praise and thank Him, you will notice a change in your
state of mind and emotions. And you will be able to pray to God more effectively.</li>
<li><b>Why is fasting important?</b><br><br>
Fasting brings us closer to God. By fasting regularly, we are able to come closer to God and are able to know His
Will for us more clearly. <br><br>Fasting takes our relationship with God to the next level.</li>
<li><b>How to fast?</b><br><br>
There are different kinds of fasting and different durations for different kinds of fasting. Fasting can vary in duration
and nature. <br><br>It can be for half a day once a week to a stretch of forty continuous days or more.
For beginners, one can plan to fast once a week for half a day (for example, by giving up breakfast and lunch).
Fasting does not mean that one should avoid drinking
water. <br><br>In fact, our water intake should be higher during the day of fasting. The day of fasting is to be
spent with additional time in prayer. And one can break fast late afternoon or evening. Many people
break their fast at 3:00 PM, which is the time when our Lord Jesus died for us on the cross, saved us
from the wrath of sin and conquered death.<br><br>
Fasting as a group is very powerful. People can get together to fast and pray and intercede for each
other’s needs.<br><br>
You can refer to the internet to find out more about different kinds of fasting.</li>
<li><b>What is the 3 O’clock Prayer?</b><br><br>
3 O’clock in the afternoon is called the hour of great mercy. It is the time when our Lord Jesus Christ
died for us on the cross and redeemed the world. <br><br>It is this moment when God changed the world
forever. <br><br>The 3
O’clock prayer reminds us of the Passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ and His sacrifice on the cross in order to save you, me and all of us. The Passion of Jesus Christ is
the proof of His love for us.
Please refer to the section on prayers for the 3 O’clock
Prayer.</li>
<li><b>What is the Bible?</b><br><br>
The Bible is God’s Love Story. It is His love story of how He loves us, His children. We all are God’s
children. <br><br>As you read through the Bible, you will learn about God’s wonderful plans for us. The Bible
describes how God created everything, how He loves us, what He desires from us, how and why He
sent Jesus to die for us, what instructions and advice He has for us for our day to day lives, and many
more interesting and inspiring truths.<br><br>
The Bible is a compilation of many books written by multiple authors who were inspired by the leading
of the
Holy Spirit. <br><br>Therefore, the Bible is God’s Word.<br><br>
The Bible contains:<br><br>


- God’s Love Story<br>
- Our identity in Christ<br>
- A wonderful collection of true historical stories<br>
- The life of Jesus<br>
- God’s encouraging promises for us<br>
- Instructions and advice for day to day life (life’s instruction book)<br>
- God’s unwavering love for us, especially in times of despair, pain and trouble</li>
<li><b>What is God’s Love Story in the Bible all about?</b><br><br>
The Bible is God’s Love Story. It is His love story of how He loves us, His children. The Bible tells us
how God
created the heavens and earth, how He created man, His love for us, how and why He sent Jesus to die
for us and His wonderful promises and plans for us.<br><br>
If you read through the Old Testament of the Bible, you will learn how God brought His beloved
people out of Egypt and liberated them from slavery, how He parted the waters of the sea and made a
road in the sea so that His people could cross the sea unharmed, how God protected and guided His
people from a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night.<br><br>
You will also read stories of how God provided bread from heaven and water from a rock when His dear
people were in the desert. <br><br>There are stories in the Bible of how people disobeyed God and hurt Him.
But God always forgave them and blessed them in His love for them. The Israelites were in the desert
for forty years but their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell even after walking so much
in the desert.<br><br>
These are just some of the stories from the Bible. You will find many more amazing stories of God’s love
when you read the Bible.</li>
<li><b>Is the Bible really true?</b><br><br>
Yes, the Bible is true. The Bible is God’s Word. Many people debate about the accuracy of what is
mentioned
in the Bible. Many of the questions raised by people have already been answered over a period of time.
For example, many questions got answered when archaeological evidence, historical records, etc. were
found. <br><br>Many questions pertaining to science got answered as new scientific evidences surfaced and
people were able to connect them to what is written in the Bible. <br><br>Likewise, many other questions which
people have got (about the accuracy of the truths mentioned in the Bible) will get answered in future as
people get access to newer scientific information, historical evidences, etc.<br><br>
What is important for us is to believe in God’s love for us and God’s Word, the Holy Bible. All questions
will be answered in His time. We are to believe in God and have faith in God.</li>
<li><b>How am I to read the Bible?</b><br><br>
The Bible is a collection of different kinds of books. <br><br>Some books contain stories, some contains words
of wisdom, some are poetic books, some are books giving us specific instructions, some books tell us
about Jesus and His ministry on earth, some are books which encourage us and some books give us a
glimpse of what is to come in future.<br><br>
If you try to read the Bible from the beginning to the end considering it to be one thick novel, then you
will definitely lose interest in a few days. <br><br>Therefore, it is good
to know how and what to read in the Bible depending on what you want to know and what you are
seeking.<br><br>
The Bible has two sections: The Old Testament (time before Jesus) and the New Testament (time of
and after
Jesus). <br><br>If you want to read stories about God’s creation and about His people during the historical days,
you can read books which contain those stories in the Old Testament (e.g., Genesis, Exodus, Joshua,
etc.). <br><br>If you want to read about the story of Jesus and the Church that He established, you can read the
first five books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts of the Apostles).<br><br> If you want
to read and sing praises to God, you can read and meditate through the book of Psalms.</li>
<li><b>How to meditate on Bible verses?</b><br><br>
The Bible is full of God’s promises for us. As we read through the Bible, specific verses might catch our
attention. We are to pray that the Holy Spirit may guide us and teach us His Word. <br><br>And God will reveal
His plan, His promises and His Will for us. We need to read His Word, the Bible with faith in our hearts.</li>
<li><b>What are some of the powerful promises of God (in the Bible)?</b><br><br>
The Bible is full of God’s promises for us. You will find some examples in Section III of this book (section
for prayers). These prayers contain God’s promises for us and
specific scripture verses are also mentioned at the end of the prayers. <br><br>You can refer to them and
meditate upon these verses for God’s blessings to touch you in a mighty way.</li>
<li><b>Jesus died a painful death. How can He be God?</b><br><br>
God, the Creator of heaven and earth is our Loving Heavenly Father. And Jesus is the Son of God. It is
God’s love for us that made God send His Son Jesus to earth, to be the sacrificial Lamb and to die on the
cross so that we are saved from sin and eternal death. <br><br>Who can save us from sin and eternal death
except for God? Who can love us more than Jesus so as to die for me, you and every one of us, when<br><br>
many people do not even know who Jesus is?<br>
Jesus died to save each one of us, and many of us do not even know it. Who can love us more than
Him?</li>
<li><b>God is all powerful. God can forgive our sins by His power. Why did Jesus have to die for us?</b><br><br>
God, our Father is a Loving God. Words cannot describe how much He loves each one of us. However,
God is true to His principles as well. God’s justice and righteousness requires that sinners should be 
punished. <br><br>But at the same time, He loves us tremendously as well. And His love and mercy requires that
we sinners be set free. <br><br>God took care of both these requirements by sending Jesus, our Savior to this
world to take our place and face the consequences
of our sins. <br><br>Such is the love of our God for us! Who can match this love?</li>
<li><b>How did Jesus overcome death? What is resurrection?</b><br><br>
Lord Jesus Christ allowed himself to be crucified on the cross as our substitute so that our sins are
forgiven and washed away. He died in our place and was buried. <br><br>He overcame death and came back
to life on the third day. This is called resurrection.<br><br>
After His resurrection, He was with His disciples for forty days and then He ascended to Heaven. He will
come back to earth again in His Glory.
Jesus is our Savior. Whoever will call upon His Holy Name will be saved.</li>
<li><b>What is special about Jesus Christ? What is unique about Jesus Christ?</b><br><br>
Jesus Christ is the Son of God. There are many things unique about Jesus. Jesus came to earth to live
amongst us and show us how to live a Godly life. He was born to Mary, a virgin and He took birth in a
manger. <br><br>As He is God, He could have chosen all the riches of the world for His luxury when He was on
earth. <br><br>Instead, He chose the humble living style of common men. He wanted to dwell among us.
The angels sang and celebrated when He was born. <br><br>A special star shone in His honor and wise men
from far came to pay Him respect.
He showed us how to avoid sin and temptation and live Godly lives. He died for us on the cross to
redeem us forever from sin and death. <br><br>Where else have you ever heard of God dying for us in order to
save us and bring us close to Him so that we are with Him forever?
Passion of Jesus and His death on the cross is the demonstration of God, our Heavenly Father’s love for
us.
Jesus resurrected on the third day proving victory over death. He is our Answer for everything. <br><br>In fact,
He is our only Answer. He is our Healer, our Provider, our Protector, our Master, our God, our Friend,
our Guide, our Brother, our King, our Lord, and the list goes on.<br><br>
People tend to bring their best offerings in the presence of their gods. Jesus, the Son of God does not
desire these kind of offerings. <br><br>He desires that we bring to Him our brokenness, our problems, our
sickness, our miseries so that He can take those away from us and fill us with His grace, His mercy and
His love.</li>
<li><b>What is special about the Blood of Christ? Why do people keep talking about the Blood of
Christ?</b><br><br>
The Blood of Christ has a very special significance. When one believes in Jesus, the Son of God and
accepts Jesus as his/her Savior, the Blood of Christ washes away his/her sins and saves him/her from
eternal death.<br><br>
During the times of Mosaic Law (during the ancient Old Testament days), once a year, the priest had to
make an offering of the blood of animals on the altar of the temple to seek forgiveness for the sins of
the people. <br><br>This blood offering of animals was done every year. As per the law, without the shedding of
blood there is no forgiveness.
The Passion, Sacrifice and Blood of Jesus on the cross has redeemed us from sins once and for all. <br><br>When
we believe in Him, confess our sins to Him and repent, He forgives us, washes away our sins in His
Precious Blood and we are saved forever.<br><br>
The phrase “Blood of Christ” is the expression of the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross and the
complete atoning work of Jesus on our behalf. Jesus bled and died for you, for me and for all of us. <br><br>We
were sinners and now redeemed when we have accepted Jesus as our Savior. The Blood of Christ
protects us from danger.</li>
<li><b>If someone prays to other gods along with Jesus, what will Jesus think? How will Jesus feel?</b><br><br>
How will you feel if the person whom you love does not love you as much as you deserve and desire?
You will feel sad. But you will still continue to love that person and wait in hope.
Likewise, Jesus feels pain when we do not give Him the first place in our lives. However, Jesus
understands our hearts and minds. <br><br>When someone does not love God as our Loving Father and does
not give Him the first place in his/her life, Jesus waits patiently that one day, every one of us will know
the Truth and the Truth will set us free.<br><br>
Jesus waits patiently that one day we all will be united to God, in His Love.</li>
<li><b>How can people worship Jesus nailed on the Cross and in pain? It feels so heartless and painful.</b><br><br>
The Cross reminds us of God’s love for us, how God sent His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ to
die for us on the Cross in order to redeem us from sin, sickness and death. <br><br>The Cross signifies the Good
News that God loves us and we can be with Him forever when we accept Jesus as our personal Savior.<br><br>
The Cross signifies hope and love. When we look at the Cross from that perspective, we
understand the true meaning of the importance of Jesus on the Cross.
We should also keep in mind that our Lord Jesus Christ has resurrected and conquered death. He is
our Living God!</li>
<li><b>Christians have adopted Western culture. Do I also have to be like them if I believe in Jesus Christ?</b><br><br>
Transformation happens in the heart and in the mind. Believing in Jesus does not require external
changes. <br><br>When one believes in Jesus and spends time in solitude and prayer, the Holy Spirit guides
him/her on how to come closer to God.<br><br>
Some people may adopt new things in their culture and community but that is not mandatory. Our
hearts and minds are more important to God than worldly things.</li>
<li><b>I believe in Jesus. Is there something that has to change in my lifestyle?</b><br><br>
Yes. But you need not force yourself to change anything in your lifestyle. <br><br>Once you believe in Jesus as
your personal Savior, commit your heart, mind, spirit and time
to Him. Spend time in His Presence in solitude, in silence and spend time in prayer. <br><br>Once you develop
this discipline, the Holy Spirit will guide you in developing a deeper and more personal relationship
with God.</li>
<li><b>Do Christians drink wine in the church?</b><br><br>
No. This is a wrong impression about Christians. <br><br>How about attending a church service? That way, you
can listen to the sermon, see the rituals and understand the meaning of the rituals.</li>
<li><b>Church is a place for worshipping God. How can someone enter a place of worship wearing
shoes?</b><br><br>
When we accept Christ as our Savior, we ourselves are the temple of God and the Holy Spirit resides in
us. Important for us is to question ourselves if our hearts and our minds are clean and pure before we
consider outward cleanliness. <br><br>It is all about the attitude of heart and mind when we follow Jesus.
Generally, one need not take off shoes when entering a church. <br><br>However, there are many churches in
small towns and villages where people prefer to take off their shoes when entering churches in order to
keep the churches clean.</li>
<li><b>What do I have to do to follow Christ? What do I have to give up if I believe in Christ?</b><br><br>
Believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and bring all your prayer petitions to Him in confidence
that He has great plans for you. <br><br>Know in your heart that He is our God, our Healer, our Redeemer,
our Friend and our Deliverer.<br><br>
Bring discipline in your daily life to spend time in God’s
Presence every day and spend time in prayer. <br><br>And pray to Jesus that He may guide you in each and
every step of your life. Ask Him in prayer about what you need to give up and pray to Him that He may
guide you and enable you in the power of the Holy Spirit to transform your life for good.<br><br>
You do not need to give up your lifestyle of food, clothing, shelter, culture or anything like that. <br><br>Focus
on inner transformation of your heart and mind and allow Jesus to show you the way.</li>
<li><b>What are the rituals that I need to follow if I believe in Jesus Christ?</b><br><br>
What is important is our intimate relationship with God. Rituals are secondary. God knows our needs.<br><br>
Bring discipline in your daily life to spend time in God’s
Presence every day and spend time in prayer. <br><br>There is no specific format that needs to be followed for
praying. As you start spending time in God’s Presence, He will guide you and you will start enjoying
your journey with Him.<br><br>
You can also discuss with other followers of Jesus if you want to know more or have specific
questions in mind.</li>
<li><b>Is it necessary to go to church?</b><br><br>
God loves you. Do you love God? Are you happy and satisfied with the progress that you have made
in your spiritual journey in knowing God? Or do you want to know Him and love Him more? <br><br>Do you
want to come closer to Him and experience His grace and blessings in your life?<br><br>
Do not go to the church for the sake of a ritual. Go to the church for the love of God, for the sake of
your personal relationship with God. <br><br>And once you experience God’s love more, let God lead you and
guide you in your walk with Him.</li>
<li><b>What is idol worship?</b><br><br>
When someone adores or worships anything or anyone more than the true God, it is called idol worship.<br><br>
Someone may adore or worship a statue thinking that it is God or someone may adore or admire a
famous celebrity more than anyone else. Someone may love money more than anything or anyone else.<br><br>
These are examples of idol worship.
We are created to love and worship our God, who is the Creator of heavens and earth. <br><br>He is our Loving
Father and we are His children. He should have the first place in our lives above everything and
everyone.</li>
<li><b>Why do people pray to idols? Should people not pray to idols?</b><br><br>
People generally follow what they see others do or what they have learnt from their elders. Most often,
people do not question rituals and do not try to understand the intent behind certain rituals and
actions. <br><br>There are many people who have a false belief that statues and idols are God. And that is how
many people end up praying to idols.<br><br>
Once we start getting curious about what we do and why we do, we get in the mode of seeking the
truth. <br><br>The ultimate truth is with God. When we seeks God’s Truth with our hearts, God starts revealing
Himself and His love more and more and His Truth sets us free.
Is there any need to pray to idols when we can pray to our Father God?</li>
<li><b>Many people worship sun, moon, stars, planets and nature. Is it wrong to worship nature?</b><br><br>
God created heaven and earth. God created everything that is in heaven and on earth. Nature, sun,
moon, stars
and planets are His creation. <br><br>Should people worship creation or the Creator?
Some people think that sun, moon, stars and planets are gods or they think that God resides in these 
things. <br><br>Why not put our focus on the Creator God who is also our Loving Heavenly Father? Why not
worship our Loving Heavenly Father who created us and loves us and longs for our love?</li>
<li><b>Some Christians always talk about sin. They are sadistic people. Why does anyone have to discuss
about sin?</b><br><br>
God created us in His image but sin separated us from God. In order to draw us back to Himself, God
sent His Son, Lord Jesus Christ to die for us on the cross as a sacrifice for all the sins that we have
committed. <br><br>And through the sacrificial death of Lord Jesus and His Resurrection, we are saved from
eternal sin and death – if we accept Jesus, the Son of God as our Savior and Lord.
People who understand this truth can be very excited to share this truth with others in order that
others also may get saved. <br><br>And that is why many people talk about sin, consequences of sin and way of
getting saved from sin.</li>
<li><b>Not everyone is a sinner. How can someone say that everyone is born as a sinner?</b><br><br>
Adam and Eve, the first human beings whom God created in His own image disobeyed God and sin
came to earth through them.
We are taught during our childhood that we should always share and care for others. And keeping
something only for ourselves and not sharing with others is being selfish, greedy and is wrong.<br><br>
Did you observe small babies? When you give a baby a toy, the baby holds it in his/her hands tightly.
And when you try to take it away, the baby resists, pulls back and cries. Isn’t the baby being selfish?<br><br>
Who taught this habit to this baby? No one. Then how did the baby learn this habit? This is an
example of how sin has penetrated in our lives even before birth.<br><br>
Many of us have trouble with the concept of sin. At times, it is difficult to accept that even when we are
trying to be good, there are areas of our lives and situations when we end up having bad thoughts,
anger, jealously, lust, tell lies or hurt others with our comments.<br><br>
And then we realize the need to be liberated from all sins forever. And this is only possible through the
forgiveness that we get from God through Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><b>How can we stay away from sin?</b><br><br>
As we walk more and more closely with God, we become more and more aware of what is right and
what is wrong.<br><br>
And God’s Holiness helps us stay away from sin.
It is important for us to develop a close relationship with God.</li>
<li><b>How can we be forgiven for our sins?</b><br><br>
Jesus died for our sins. When we believe in Him, that He is the Son of God and accept Him as our
Savior, we can confess our sins to Him, repent and seek His forgiveness. <br><br>Then He washes away our sins
and forgives us. We become a new creation in Him. All our past sins are forgiven and forgotten by God.</li>
<li><b>I always help others and care for them. I do not have any sins in me. Why talk about sin?</b><br><br>
Doing good and helping others need not necessarily mean that one does not have sins. Sin is not just
about stealing, murder, robbery or such crimes. <br><br>When we are angry, arrogant, jealous, proud, rude,
tell lies, lust, etc., then also we sin.
Sometimes it is hard to accept our own shortcomings and failures. <br><br>It is even harder to confess and talk
about it.
God desires that we become free from sins. <br><br>He desires us to acknowledge our mistakes and sins to Him
and repent so that He can wash us in the blood of Christ and cleanse us.</li>
<li><b>What is confession of sins? Why should I confess?</b><br><br>
Confession of sins is the process of becoming aware of the sins that we have committed in our lives
and the act of acknowledging to God that we have made those mistakes in our lives. Once we confess
our sins, we also need to repent and ask Him for His forgiveness.<br><br>
The Word of God promises us - <font color="Blue"><i>"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins
and purify us from all unrighteousness"</i></font></li>
<li><b>What is repentance? How should one repent?</b><br><br>
In addition to confession of sins, God desires that we also repent for those sins and our past wrong
actions. <br><br>He desires for us to turn away from our old sinful activities and instead follow Him.
Repentance is about feeling sorry or contrite for having committed mistakes and sins. True repentance
brings in a desire in us not to repeat those mistakes again.<br><br>
When we reach out to God asking for His forgiveness, we also pray to Him to give us His strength to
become better.<br><br>
Repentance does not mean that we become perfect. God, our Loving Heavenly Father understands that
we may backslide at times. <br><br>However, every time we reach out to Him with a contrite heart asking for His
forgiveness, we will receive it. In this process, God slowly molds us to become better and better. And
our relationship with God deepens.<br><br>
The Bible says that when we repent and seek God, Jesus Himself will help us.
<font color="Blue"><i>"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who
speaks to the Father in our defense - Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <br><br>He is the atoning sacrifice for our
sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."</i></font><br><br>
We are to learn from God’s nature and follow Him closely. We sin and we ask for God’s forgiveness.<br><br>
And every time, God forgives us. Similarly, we are to forgive others. The Bible instructs us,
<font color="Blue"><i>"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."</i></font></li>
<li><b>What is meant by the Armor of God?</b><br><br>
The Armor of God refers to the spiritual armor that we can rely upon for our day to day battles against
the power of negativities. <br><br>The Armor of God comprises of the helmet of salvation, the belt of truth, the
breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the Gospel of peace, the shield of faith and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the Word of God.<br><br>
Please refer to Section III of this book (the section on prayers) to find out how to pray and daily put
on the
Armor of God for God’s protection in our lives. Make this prayer a part of your daily morning routine
and put on the Armor of God every morning. <br><br>This prayer will prepare you to face each day’s spiritual
challenges in God’s strength and power. <br><br>Putting on the spiritual Armor of God protects our minds and
hearts from negative thoughts and negative emotions and enables us to stand firm against spiritual
attacks.</li>
<li><b>What does it mean to be set free in Christ? What is freedom in Christ?</b><br><br>
The first question that one might ask is, set free from what? Take a few moments to reflect upon your
life. <br><br>Are you aware of the presence of any similar attitudes and actions in your life like fear, jealousy,
bitterness, anger, unforgiveness, past hurts, addiction, lust, poor self-image, etc.? It is a natural
tendency to initially deny the presence of such attitudes.<br><br>
However, when we genuinely examine our hearts, we might find areas in our lives where we want to
improve and become better but we fail repeatedly when we try to change in our own strength. And we
ask, can we ever be set free from these negative thoughts, actions and attitudes?<br><br>
Jesus is the only one who can set us free. Jesus says,<br><br>
<font color="Blue"><i>“And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</i></font><br><br>
Accepting Jesus as our personal Savior, confessing and repenting for the sins that we have committed,
asking for His forgiveness and His strength to become better, believing in our hearts that the death of
Jesus on the cross and His resurrection has made it possible for us to live a life free from sin, spending
time in God’s presence, spending time reading the Bible and spending time in prayer will lead us away
from sin and towards God.</li>
