<li><b>Putting on the Armor of God</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed"><<< Make this prayer a part of your daily morning routine.
This prayer will prepare you to face each day’s spiritual challenges in God’s strength and power. >>></font><br><br>
Dear Lord, as I get out of bed today, I know I am stepping on to a battlefield. But I also know that You
have given me everything I need to stand firm. So in the power of Your Holy Spirit, I put on the armor of
God:<br><br>
First, I place the helmet of salvation on my head. Please protect my mind and my thoughts. Please
guard my eyes, allowing no sin to creep in. Please focus my thoughts on the things of God. Let the
breastplate of righteousness keep my heart and my emotions safe. I pray that I won't be governed by
my feelings, but by truth. I wrap Your Word around me like a belt. Please safeguard me from error. I put
on the sandals of peace to guide my steps. Please plant my feet in Your truth. Empower me to stand
firm against attacks.<br><br>
Next, I take up the shield of faith. Lord, please protect me from Satan's fiery arrows. Place me shoulder
to shoulder with Your army to oppose the Devil's schemes. Finally, I take up the sword of the Spirit, Your
Holy Word. Lord, please help me to read the Bible in fresh, exciting ways so that I will always be ready to
deflect attacks and share Your Truth with others.<br><br>
I know I'll face assaults today, Lord. But You have empowered me to stand firm. Lord, please give me
strength for the battle today. The Joy of the Lord is my strength. In Jesus Name, I pray. Amen.<br><br>

Hallowed be Your name.<br>

Your will be done,<br>
On earth as in heaven,<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
Forgive us our sins,<br>

<li><b>Prayer for Lord’s Protection</b><br>
We, who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, Shall abide under the shadow of the
Almighty.<br><br>
I will say of the Lord, “You are my refuge and my fortress; My God, in You I will trust.”<br><br>
Surely You shall deliver us from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence.
You shall cover us with Your feathers,
And under Your wings we shall take refuge; Your truth shall be our shield and buckler. We
shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at our side,
And ten thousand at our right hand; But it shall not come near us.<br><br>
Only with our eyes shall we look, And see the reward of the wicked.
Because we have made You Lord, who is our refuge, Even the Most High, our dwelling place,
No evil shall befall us,
Nor shall any plague come near our dwelling; For You shall give Your angels charge over us,
To keep us in all your ways.<br><br>
In their hands they shall bear us up, Lest we dash our foot against a stone.
We shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent we shall trample
underfoot.<br><br>
“Because we have set our love upon You, therefore You will deliver us;
You will set us on high, because we have known Your name.<br><br>
We shall call upon You, and You will answer us; You will be with us in trouble;
You will deliver us and honor us. With long life You will satisfy us,
And show us Your salvation.”<br><br>

<li><b>The Lord is our Provider (He takes care of all our needs)</b><br>
Lord, You are my Shepherd, I lack nothing. I have all that I need.
You make me lie down in green pastures, You lead me beside quiet waters,
You refresh my soul. You renew my strength.
You guide me along the right paths bringing honor to Your Name.<br><br>
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid,
For You, my Lord, are with me;
Your rod and Your staff protect and comfort me.<br><br>
You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;<br><br>
My cup overflows with blessings.
Surely Your goodness and unfailing love will follow me all the days of my life,
And Lord, I will dwell in Your house forever.<br><br>

Lord, I know that You will show me which path to take.<br><br>

Bless me that I may be obedient to You and follow Your instructions. Lord, let it be to me according to
Your Word and Your Will.<br><br>

coming. Lord Jesus, You have promised Your peace to all Your children. You said, “Peace I leave with

neither let it be afraid.”<br><br>

forgiveness for all the sins that I have committed in my thoughts, in my words and in my deeds.<br><br>

- in your relationships with others<br><br>
Bring to the Lord all the mistakes that you have ever done and ask for His forgiveness]]]</font>
Lord, how can I know all the sins that are lurking in my heart? Who can discern their own errors?
Please forgive my hidden faults. Cleanse me from these hidden faults. Keep me away from deliberate
sins. <br><br>Don't let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin.
I have sinned and only by Your grace, my sins are washed away because I admit that Jesus Christ is my
Savior. He came to this world to take away my sins and my sickness. By His grace and His death on the
cross for us, I am able to call You as my Father.<br><br>
Lord, You are so powerful and so loving. You saved the city of Nineveh and delivered all the people
there when they repented for their sins. Lord, You are gracious and
merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness.<br><br>
Please sanctify me and purify my heart and my mind. Forgive me of the sins that I have committed.
Wash me in the precious blood of Jesus and sanctify me. I give You thanks and I praise Your Holy and
Mighty Name.

Loving Heavenly Father, I am hurt. I feel that I will not be able to forgive <font color="DarkRed">[[[mention the name of the
person whom you find difficult to forgive]]]</font>. I am finding it difficult to forget this incident. But Lord, I
know that You do not want me to carry unforgiveness in my heart. There is so much that I can learn
from You. You sent Your only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ to this world to die
for me on the Cross and to take away my sins and my sickness. In His precious blood, my sins are
forgiven and my sins are washed away forever. And Father, You have said that You will not remember
my past sins anymore.<br><br>

<li><b>Prayer for faith and hope in God</b><br>
Lord, I come to You with my prayer intentions. I know that You hear my prayers. Lord, there are times
when I am weak and I have doubts in my mind. There are times when my faith is weak. Please forgive
me of the moments when my faith is weak. Please forgive my unbelief.<br><br>
Faith comes by hearing the Word of God. Please bless me that I may spend more time reading the Bible,

actually happen. It gives us assurance about things we cannot see. Please bless me that my faith in You
will increase.<br><br>

have for me is the best plan ever possible. Teach me to be obedient to You.<br><br>
You are the God of hope. I pray that You will fill me completely with joy and peace because I trust in
You. Then I will overflow with confident hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
I also pray for other people who might be struggling with their faith and need to experience the Light of
Hope, which is in You, Lord.<br><br>

and have tried to harm us knowingly and unknowingly. Father, You have instructed us to forgive others.
Therefore, we forgive each and every one of these people and we pray for peace and prosperity of
these people. Bless them with Your Grace, Peace and Mercy.<br><br>
Lord Jesus, You have said - But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to
those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be 
sons of your Father
in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on
the unjust.<br><br>
Lord, we are obedient to You. And we pray for all these people that You may bless them with Your Love,
Peace and Joy. May they know You and experience You in a very personal way. Father, I pray in the
mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.<br><br>

<li><b>Prayer for surrender - allowing God to take charge of my life</b><br>
Lord, You have said, “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be
opened to you.” Here I am, Lord. I ask You to come into my life. I seek Your Will, Lord. I surrender my
life to You. Lord, I give You the first place in my life. Please take charge and control of my life for I know
that Your plan for me is the best plan ever possible.<br><br>
I know that You are our Loving God who answers our prayers. In case what I pray for is not good for me,
please bless me with what is best for me. Holy Lord, You have promised that You have great plans for
me and my life, plans of peace, to give me a bright future and hope. I believe that the plan that You
have for me is the best
plan ever possible. As heavens are higher than the earth, so are Your thoughts and Your plans higher
than my thoughts and my plans. Teach me to be obedient to You. Let it be to me according to your
Word.<br><br>
Teach me Your ways, O Lord, that I may live according to Your truth! Grant me purity of heart, so that I
may honor You.<br><br>
Father, I pray in the Mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.<br><br>
