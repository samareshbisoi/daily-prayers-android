<li><b>Imelda’s story – Childlike Prayers</b><br>
Imelda did not have a job and desperately needed a job. She had to take care of her family and getting
a job and having money to care of the family was urgent. One night, she walked out of her house,
looked up at the starlit sky and prayed, “Father, I need a job. Help me.”<br><br>
She had not applied to any companies for jobs yet. However, the next day, she got two job offers – job
offers that she received from her network of friends. She praised and thanked God, our Loving Heavenly
Father for hearing and answering her prayers.<br><br>
Indeed, our Loving Heavenly Father knows our hearts and our minds. We can always approach Him like
little children. He listens to our childlike prayers.<br><br>
<u>Matthew 18: 2-4</u><br>
<font color="Blue">Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, and said, “Assuredly, I say to you,
unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of
heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</font></li>
<li><b>Prity’s story – Ask and you shall receive</b><br>
I got into a crowded bus with my cousin. There was no place to sit. Suddenly, I had a muscle cramp on
my leg. I was in pain and desperately wanted to sit down. But there were no empty seats. I prayed to
Jesus to help me. Even before I could finish my prayer, I saw one girl getting up from her seat and going
towards to the door to get down. I sat down on that seat and thanked Jesus.<br><br>
This is just one story. I can share many more stories. Every time I pray to Jesus, He answers my prayers. I
thank God.<br><br>
<u>Matthew 7: 7-11</u><br>
<font color="Blue">“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone
who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man is
there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give
him a serpent? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will
your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</font></li>
<li><b>Purnima’s story – Nothing is impossible for God</b><br>
I had many health problems. I had to take medication for multiple ailments. I used to be very tensed about my health. <br><br>
I surrendered my life to Jesus and started praying to Him regularly and sincerely. Jesus has
healed me of all problems and I have stopped taking medicines. Now I only take one medicine for
blood pressure. That’s all. I thank and praise Jesus for His miracles in my life.<br><br>
Earlier, I used to feel very impatient and anxious during evenings. I could not even imagine being alone
during the evenings and during the nights. I was scared of darkness. The Lord has blessed me with His
strength. I can now stay alone even late in the night. If there is a power cut, I am at peace in the candle 
light.<br><br>
There is so much that God has blessed me with, in every aspect of my life. He has blessed me with fame
and success in my career. All glory and honor belongs to Him.<br><br>
Every morning, I start my day praying to Jesus, surrendering myself completely to Him. I thank Him for
His blessings every night before I go to bed. Whenever I get free time during the day, I remember Him,
praise Him and thank Him for His blessings and His grace upon me and my dear ones.<br><br>
<u>Jeremiah 32:27</u><br>
<font color="Blue">“Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</font><br><br>
<u>Philippians 4: 13</u><br>
<font color="Blue">I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</font></li>
<li><b>Alphonsa’s story – The Lord is our Provider, we do not need anything more</b><br>
I was offered an assignment to work in France for a year. I prayed and said yes to that offer. My
colleagues had warned me that it is extremely difficult to stay in France as most people do not
understand English and it is a big challenge that one has to face every day if one does not speak French.
They told me that the client workplace was not very friendly. They also told me that it is a very different
culture and there are not many Indians in that city of France. Hence, life would be depressing and
difficult there.<br><br>
I offered all these comments to Jesus in prayer. The Lord put the desire in my heart to pray for the place
where I was going and also to pray for the people whom I would meet there. So during the next few
months while the paperwork for my assignment was getting ready, I started praying for the place
regularly. I also prayed for my future colleagues and my future workplace.<br><br>
Our Lord is so faithful to His promises. He took care of the smallest of my needs. On the flight to
Marseille (in France), I met a French lady who was very fluent in English. She gave me tips and advice
which was very
helpful for me. <br><br>I got out of the airport and got into the taxi. To my pleasant surprise, the taxi driver could
speak English! It was so easy for me to reach the hotel. In many different ways and in many situations, the
Lord guided me. He blessed me with good friends during my stay in France. I did not face any challenges in
my workplace or while working with my clients. In fact, I made some very good friends at the client place. I
found a church where there was English service every Sunday. I found a small apartment which was the
perfect place for me to stay.<br><br>
Rather than having a challenging assignment in France, my stay was so blessed in God’s grace that I can
hardly describe in words. I miss my wonderful days in France and l hope to visit the place again. I have
made wonderful friends there. My additional bonus was that God used me as His instrument to share
His love with many people. I praise Jesus!<br><br>
<u>Philippians 4: 19-20</u><br>
<font color="Blue">And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Now to our God
and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</font></li>
<li><b>Herawati’s story – Lord Jesus is our Healer</b><br>
I go for walks every morning with my husband. One Sunday morning, as I was walking, I felt very weak. I
could not walk. My husband helped me to slowly get back home. And I lay down on the bed. I had never
felt like this earlier. I did not know what was happening. As I was lying on the bed, I thought about Jesus.
I suddenly realized that my daughter must be in church. I took my cellphone and sent her a text
message asking her to say “Hello” to Jesus on my behalf and to tell Him that I am feeling weak.<br><br>
My daughter called me up and we both prayed to Jesus for my healing. Jesus died for us on the cross and
took away our sins and sickness. So when we prayed to Jesus, we claimed His promise that I am healed by
the Stripes of Jesus. I imagined in my mind that I am healed. After a few minutes, I realized that I was feeling
strong and normal.<br><br>
I praise God for all His promises are true! Thank You, Jesus! You have healed me.<br><br>
<u>Psalm 103: 1-5</u><br>
<font color="Blue">Praise the Lord, my soul;<br>
all my inmost being, praise His Holy Name. Praise the Lord, my soul,<br>
and forget not all His benefits— who forgives all your sins<br>
and heals all your diseases,<br>
who redeems your life from the pit<br>
and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so
that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</font><br><br>
<u>Isaiah 53: 5</u><br>
<font color="Blue">But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities;<br>
the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed.</font></li>
<li><b>Amelia’s story of healing – Perseverance in prayer</b><br>
Amelia had frequent ear infections as a young child. As a result, the ear specialist had to put three sets
of tubes in her ears. The last set of tubes left a hole in one eardrum. Although the ear specialist
suggested closing it surgically, Amelia’s parents prayed to God in faith that God would heal her ear. Few
years after the ear infections stopped, Amelia noticed a funny noise in that ear. Amelia’s parents prayed 
to God and He indicated that He was healing
Amelia’s ear.<br><br>
At her next pediatrician’s appointment, Amelia’s parents expected the doctor to declare that her ear
was healed. But to their surprise, the doctor mentioned that the perforation had not changed.<br><br>
What was going on? The parents persisted in praying and declaring healing over that ear, despite the
pediatrician’s repeat diagnosis every year during annual checkup.<br><br>
Four years later, they had to visit the ear specialist for a different concern. He checked Amelia’s ear
and announced that the perforation is healed!<br><br>
We often see that God’s promises manifest immediately. However, there are times when God requires
our perseverance in prayer. And it is our duty to hold on to God’s promises with complete faith that
our God is faithful and keeps all His promises.<br><br>
<u>1 Thessalonians 5: 16-18</u><br>
<font color="Blue">Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus for you.</font><br><br>
<u>Psalm 30:2</u><br>
<font color="Blue">O Lord my God, I cried out to You,<br>
And You healed me.</font><br><br>
<u>Luke 17: 19</u><br>
<font color="Blue">And Jesus said to him, “Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</font></li>
<li><b>Saraswati’s story – Our God knows our needs even when we do not know</b><br>
<u>Psalm 42:1</u><br>
<font color="Blue">As the deer pants for the water brooks,<br>
So pants my soul for You, O God.</font><br><br>
I had a personal experience with Lord Jesus when He healed me from a major illness. Since then, I was
spiritually thirsty and hungry to know more about God's love and His ways. I had a deep desire in my
heart to have a mentor who would guide me and teach me more about God and spiritual matters. I
prayed to the Lord. I looked up to some elders for guidance but most often they all were busy. I kept
praying for a mentor with whom I can talk, discuss, worship God together and glorify His Name at all
times. Meanwhile, I started spending time in Bible
studies, praying and spending time in God's presence. <br><br>God started blessing me in multiple ways. And 
over a period of time, I stopped praying for a mentor. Other priorities got my attention and I started
praying for other intentions.<br><br>
Two years passed by. I was attending a Christian Leadership Conference. I met a faculty member and
felt a strong anointing from the Holy Spirit to talk to her. I felt a very strong connection with her but I
could not understand what that was. I felt led by the Holy Spirit to go and talk to her but I did not. I kept
silent.<br><br>
Her sessions began and I attentively listened to all that she taught in our class. She taught us how to wait
upon the Lord, how to come closer to Him and seek His Will.
After a few days, her classes got over and she was about to leave the venue. I had a strong prompting
from the Holy Spirit to talk to her but I still hesitated. I escorted her to the van and she left. I thought
this feeling will go away after a few days. But it did not.<br><br>
I prayed to God. And after two days, I sent her an e-mail and she responded back. I wondered, will she
be my mentor? But how could I ask her to be my mentor? She hardly knows me. Will she have time for
me? <br><br>Why will
she invest her time in me? I prayed and finally asked her if she will be my mentor. And she agreed.<br><br>
I praise God! He truly is a Loving God! He answered my prayer! Over a period of time, I had forgotten
to pray for this intention but the Lord remembered my prayer request and answered my prayer. He is
so faithful!<br><br>
I wanted a mentor but instead God has blessed me with additional bonus. He has blessed me with a
mentor, a coach, a loving elder sister (I have one elder brother and did not have any sister) who takes
care of me in all possible ways. God ensured that the person whom He has assigned for me
understands my background, my work and understands me as a person and can guide me in all aspects
of my life in His grace and His blessings. I thank God for blessing me with such a wonderful and loving
elder sister.<br><br>
God works in amazing ways. I would discuss certain topics with my mentor (elder sister) and learn new
things. And in the next few days, God would lead others to me who would benefit from all that I have
learnt. The Lord started using me as His instrument in helping others through me.
Thank You, Lord. Great is Your love and faithfulness! I am enjoying the journey of faith that I have
begun with our Faithful Lord and my elder sister (my Didi).<br><br>

<li><b>Paramita’s story – Our Lord is our Protector (Power of Psalm 91)</b><br>
I was in a meeting when I get a frantic message on the chat window of my laptop from my sister asking
me to pick up her phone call as mom had an accident and was being rushed to the hospital. I stepped
out of the meeting room, went to the balcony and called her. My uncle had called my sister to inform
that a coconut had fallen on my mom’s head and she was being taken to the hospital. My mom was in
our home town in another part of the country whereas my sister, brother and I stay in Bangalore which
is quite far away from our home town. For a few moments, I was tensed. I tried to call my uncle but
could not reach him. I called my aunt and spoke to her. She did not have any additional information for
me. She was getting ready to go to our house. She said she will reach there and call me. I was restless.
Who could tell me the latest? Where was my mom and how was she at that very moment? I tried to call
another uncle of mine. And then I paused. What was I doing? Why was I not reaching out to the person
who has all answers and all promises for us? I prayed to Jesus.<br><br>
Every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to bed, I pray Psalm 91. I claim God’s
promises of His
protection for my dear ones and for me. Standing on the office balcony, I prayed Psalm 91 and claimed
His promises for my mom. I surrendered my mom to the Lord and told Him that I believe in His
promises. There was a sense of peace in me. This was the peace of Christ. I was surprised with that
peace. My mom was being taken to the hospital. How could I have such peace? No wonder, the peace
of Christ surpasses all human understanding. I called up my sister and reassured her that our mom will
be safe. I told her that Jesus is in charge. I went back to the meeting.<br><br>
After the meeting got over, I called up my uncle who had taken my mom to the hospital. I spoke to him
and then spoke to my mom. My mom sounded confident that she was fine and was just a little shaky.
The doctor had advised a scan and the report was expected later in the evening.<br><br>
I called later in the evening to find out about the report from the scan. Praise God! Praise Jesus! Not a
single sign of injury. A coconut had hit my mom’s head but no injury at all! My mom had to take only
one pain killer that night as there was a slight bump on one side. And no other medicines at all!<br><br>
Later, my mom shared that as she was being taken to the hospital, she kept on calling out to Jesus to
take care of her.<br><br>
Mom noticed that after the coconut fall incident, the spondylitis problem that she had earlier had 
vanished. Maybe the impact of the coconut! Another blessing in disguise! Praise God!<br><br>
Psalm 91 is a very powerful promise of our Lord’s protection for us. I pray Psalm 91 every morning and
every night. There are many people who can give testimony of God’s protection through praying Psalm
91. And I pray that the power and promise of Psalm 91 will reach nations and peoples in every part of
the world.<br><br>
<u>Psalm 91: 9-13</u><br>
<font color="Blue">Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
No evil shall befall you,<br>
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; For He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you in all your ways.<br>
In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,<br>
The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.</font><br><br>
<u>Psalm 91: 15-16</u><br>
<font color="Blue">He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble;<br>
I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him,<br>
And show him My salvation.”</font></li>
<li><b>Amitesh’s story – Trusting God’s Wisdom</b><br>
I finished my MBA and decided to search for a job in Bangalore. I reached Bangalore and started my job
hunt. I applied in multiple companies. For weeks, I tried my best but did not get any job offer. I was
feeling frustrated and upset. I was missing home badly. I spoke to my mom and she too was missing me.
She asked me to take a break from job hunting and come home for a few days. I booked my flight ticket.
I packed my things and got ready to go home. During those days, I was staying in my friend’s house in
Bangalore. As I was just about to step out of my friend’s house, I got a phone call from one company.
They wanted me to meet them the next day for an interview. I explained to them that I was going home
for a few days. <br><br>I requested them if I could meet them once I am back. I was told that they were having
interviews the next day and I have to join work immediately upon selection. They told me that if I did
not meet them the next day, I would lose this opportunity. So I had to make a decision whether to go
home or cancel my trip home and attend this job interview.<br><br>
This job interview was for a call center job which required working during night shifts. I had been trying
for a job for weeks now and I badly wanted to start working and earning. If I cancelled my trip home, I
would not be able to meet my parents. And I knew that my mom was missing me badly. I did not know
what to do. On one hand was my career and on the other hand was meeting my parents after such a
long time. I knew that they were eager to meet me and they were equally keen that I get a good job and
settle down. I did not know what to do.<br><br>
I called up my elder sister and explained my situation to her. She asked me where I was. I told her that I
was at my friend’s door and was just about to leave for my hometown. I had one shoe on one foot,
another shoe in one hand, my phone in the other hand and I was talking to her. I did not know whether
to step inside or to wear my other shoe and step outside.<br><br>
My sister gave me some promises from the Bible and taught me how to pray to Jesus:<br><br>
<u>Proverbs 3: 5-6</u><br>
<font color="Blue">Trust in the Lord with all your heart,<br>
And lean not on your own understanding;<br>
In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br>
And He shall direct your paths.</font><br><br>
She asked me to find a quiet place and pray to Lord Jesus using the scriptures (Proverbs 3: 5-6). She
asked me to surrender my situation to Jesus and ask Him to guide me. I sat down, closed my eyes and
prayed to Lord Jesus using the Bible verses that she gave me. I told Lord Jesus that I trust in His Wisdom.
I surrendered the situation to Jesus and asked Him to guide me. A soft gentle voice spoke to me, “Go
home.” Suddenly, I felt a sense of peace.<br><br>
I decided to go home. I know many people would have thought that I was taking a wrong decision as
getting a job should be my first priority. But I was at peace because
I knew that I was obeying God’s instruction. I went home and spent good time with my parents and
friends. Very soon, I got job offers from three different companies. I did not know which one to choose
as now I had multiple options to choose from. I was very happy. I did not know that something even
better than all these job offers was on the way.<br><br>
I got another job offer for a managerial position in a good government organization and with a very
good salary. I was pleasantly surprised that they would offer me such a good salary as this was going to
be my first job. The salary
offered to me was almost four times higher than what I would have earned in a call center job in
Bangalore working night shifts.<br><br>
And here I was! Lord Jesus had blessed me with a good job, a good position in the company, a
wonderful salary and my posting is in a beautiful scenic place. I really cannot thank Him enough.<br><br>
<u>Psalm 66: 19-20</u><br>
<font color="Blue">but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer. Praise be to God,<br>
who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!</font></li>
<li><b>Subrata’s story - Jesus is my refuge and my fortress</b><br>
<font color="Blue">I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.” </font>(Psalm 91:2)<br><br>
I had recently finished construction of my house and wanted to give the ground floor on rent. I was in
need of the money that would come from the rent. My son was not keeping well and had to be taken 
to Bangalore for treatment two times a year. And the money that we would get from the rent of the
ground floor would come
in handy. But I could not find a tenant who was willing to take the place on rent. And I was worried.<br><br>
My wife had recently returned from a five days spiritual retreat and shared her experiences from the
retreat, how Lord Jesus had touched her and all other attendees. She shared with me how people pray
to Jesus, how they praise Jesus and worship Jesus. I felt encouraged and decided to pray to Jesus to help
us get a tenant for the property.<br><br>
My sister in law had shared with me about the power of God’s promises as mentioned in the Bible and
how we are to pray to Jesus in faith. I started praying sincerely to Jesus. I prayed Psalm 91 daily. In a few
days, I got a tenant who was willing to pay a rent which matched my requirements. I was still hesitant
wondering whether the tenant will be good or not and whether I should wait for another one. And then
I decided to surrender the whole situation to Jesus. Jesus is our Provider and when we surrender
ourselves and our situations to Him, He takes care of everything. And Jesus took care of everything! He
is so faithful! I got a nice tenant. The rent is good. With the extra income, I could take care of my son’s
medical expenses with ease. And my financial problem was sorted out. My son is also recovering from
the illness. I praise God! He is so loving! Indeed, we are all His children through His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>
<u>Psalm 91: 14-15</u><br>
<font color="Blue">“Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;
I will set him on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;<br>
I will be with him in trouble;<br>
I will deliver him and honor him.</font></li>
