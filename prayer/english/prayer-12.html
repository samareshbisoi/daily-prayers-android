I feel that I will not be able to forgive</p> <blockquote>[[[mention the name of the person whom you find difficult to forgive]]]. </blockquote><p align="justify">I am finding it difficult to forget this incident. But Lord, I know that You do not want me to carry unforgiveness in my heart. <br><br>There is so much that I can learn from You. You sent Your only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ to this world to die for me on the Cross and to take away my sins and my sickness. In His precious blood, my sins are forgiven and my sins are washed away forever. <br><br>And Father, You have said that You will not remember my past sins anymore. <br><br>
Lord, teach me to be kind and compassionate to others. Teach me to forgive others, just as You forgave me through our Lord Jesus Christ. Father, I pray in the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>
