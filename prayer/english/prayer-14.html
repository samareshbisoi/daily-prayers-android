              <p align="justify">Lord, I come to You with my prayer intentions. I know that You hear my prayers. Lord, there are times when I am weak and I have doubts in my mind. There are times when my faith is weak. Please forgive me of the moments when my faith is weak. Please forgive my unbelief. <br><br>
Faith comes by hearing the Word of God. Please bless me that I may spend more time reading the Bible, which is Your Holy Word. Please increase my faith. Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen. It gives us assurance about things we cannot see. Please bless me that my faith in You will increase. <br><br>
I know that You are our Loving God who answers our prayers. In case what I pray for is not good for me, please bless me with what is best for me. Holy Lord, You have promised that You have great plans for me and my life, plans of peace, to give me a bright future and hope. I believe that the plan that You have for me is the best plan ever possible. Teach me to be obedient to You. <br><br>

You are the God of hope. I pray that You will fill me completely with joy and peace because I trust in You. Then I will overflow with confident hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
I also pray for other people who might be struggling with their faith and need to experience the Light of Hope, which is in You, Lord. <br><br>
Father, in Jesus Name, I pray. Amen. </p>
