              <p align="justify">Almighty God, I come to You in prayer. You know what I am going through. I am worried and tensed. Lord, I know that it does not help if I am worried or if I am anxious. And I know that You are Almighty, Powerful and Loving. I come to You seeking Your blessings and Your peace. Lord, I know You invite all Your children to come to Your presence, including the ones like me, who are weary and burdened.<br><br> And I know that You have promised me rest in You. Lord, I give all my worries and anxieties to You because You care for me. Thank You, Lord. You are so gentle and humble at heart. I will find rest in You. 
I also lift up in prayer all Your beloved children in this world who are facing situations like mine. Bless us with Your peace. <br><br>
Father, I ask this prayer in the Mighty Name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
