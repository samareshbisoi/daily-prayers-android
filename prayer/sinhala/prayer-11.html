              <p align="justify">Loving Heavenly Father, allow me to come to Your Holy Presence and sit at Your feet. I seek Your forgiveness for all the sins that I have committed in my thoughts, in my words and in my deeds. </p>

<blockquote>[[[Ask forgiveness for all the sins and mistakes that you have done: 
- during your childhood <br>
- as a young adult <br>
- in your workplace/school/office <br>
- in your relationships with your family members <br>
- in your relationships with your relatives and friends <br>
- in your relationships with others <br>
Bring to the Lord all the mistakes that you have ever done and ask for His forgiveness]]]</blockquote> 
<p align="justify">Lord, how can I know all the sins that are lurking in my heart? Who can discern their own errors? Please forgive my hidden faults. Cleanse me from these hidden faults. Keep me away from deliberate sins. Don't let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin. <br><br>
I have sinned and only by Your grace, my sins are washed away because I admit that Jesus Christ is my Savior. He came to this world to take away my sins and my sickness. By His grace and His death on the cross for us, I am able to call You as my Father. <br><br> 
Lord, You are so powerful and so loving. You saved the city of Nineveh and delivered all the people there when they repented for their sins. Lord, You are gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness. <br><br>
Please sanctify me and purify my heart and my mind. Forgive me of the sins that I have committed. Wash me in the precious blood of Jesus and sanctify me. I give You thanks and I praise Your Holy and Mighty Name. <br><br>
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight. O Lord, You are my strength, You are my Redeemer. Please forgive me and bless me with Your Peace, Love and Joy. Please bless my family too. <br><br>
Father, I pray in the Mighty and Holy Name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
