              <p align="justify">Loving Heavenly Father, we bring to You in prayer the people who have tried to do evil to our families and have tried to harm us knowingly and unknowingly. Father, You have instructed us to forgive others. Therefore, we forgive each and every one of these people and we pray for peace and prosperity of these people. Bless them with Your Grace, Peace and Mercy. 
<br><br>Lord Jesus, You have said - But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 
<br><br>Lord, we are obedient to You. And we pray for all these people that You may bless them with Your Love, Peace and Joy. May they know You and experience You in a very personal way. Father, I pray in the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
