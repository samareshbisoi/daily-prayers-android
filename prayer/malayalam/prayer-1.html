              <p align="justify">Dear Lord, as I get out of bed today, I know I am stepping on to a battlefield. But I also know that You have given me everything I need to stand firm. So in the power of Your Holy Spirit, I put on the armor of God: 
<br><br>First, I place the helmet of salvation on my head. Please protect my mind and my thoughts. Please guard my eyes, allowing no sin to creep in. Please focus my thoughts on the things of God. Let the breastplate of righteousness keep my heart and my emotions safe. I pray that I won't be governed by my feelings, but by truth. I wrap Your Word around me like a belt. Please safeguard me from error. I put on the sandals of peace to guide my steps. Please plant my feet in Your truth. Empower me to stand firm against attacks. 
<br><br>Next, I take up the shield of faith. Lord, please protect me from Satan's fiery arrows. Place me shoulder to shoulder with Your army to oppose the Devil's schemes. Finally, I take up the sword of the Spirit, Your Holy Word. Lord, please help me to read the Bible in fresh, exciting ways so that I will always be ready to deflect attacks and share Your Truth with others. I know I'll face assaults today, Lord. But You have empowered me to stand firm. Lord, please give me strength for the battle today. The Joy of the Lord is my strength. In Jesus Name, I pray. Amen. </p>
