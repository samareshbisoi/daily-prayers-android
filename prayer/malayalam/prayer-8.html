              <p align="justify">Almighty God, You are Holy and Righteous. You are Powerful and Merciful. All authority on heaven and on earth are Yours. <br><br>
Loving God, You are God of Grace. You gave life to us all. You are our Savior. In Your hands and in Your authority, there is healing power over disease and worry. 
How Loving and Merciful You are. You gave us Your Beloved Son, Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior. All our sins and diseases are washed away on the Cross by the Healing Stripes of Jesus and His Holy Blood. We are healed! <br><br>
I confess all my weaknesses and sins to You, Lord. Forgive me, Lord. I am nothing without You and only by Your grace, I am healed. You are God of all miracles. I trust in Your mighty, loving and merciful power. You have forgiven me and healed me. Lord, I thank You for giving me a clean and new heart. Lord, I thank You for giving me Your peace. Please be with me forever. You are Emmanuel (God is with us). 
You are the Way, the Truth and the Life. You are the Light of my life. I am saved by Your love for me. Cover me with Your Precious and Holy Blood, O Lord. <br><br>
Draw me closer to You, Lord Jesus. I trust in Your mighty power. You are my Savior, Healer, Protector and Refuge. You are my God. <br><br>
Lord Jesus, You Know everything about me, my needs and my desires. Into Your mighty holy hands, I commit myself. Be it unto me according to Your Will. I am Yours. I am saved and healed. 
Father, I also pray for all my brothers and sisters who are in need of Your grace and blessings. I ask all my prayers in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
