              <p align="justify">Lord, You have said, “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.” Here I am, Lord. I ask You to come into my life. I seek Your Will, Lord. I surrender my life to You. Lord, I give You the first place in my life. Please take charge and control of my life for I know that Your plan for me is the best plan ever possible. 
<br><br>
I know that You are our Loving God who answers our prayers. In case what I pray for is not good for me, please bless me with what is best for me. Holy Lord, You have promised that You have great plans for me and my life, plans of peace, to give me a bright future and hope. I believe that the plan that You have for me is the best plan ever possible. As heavens are higher than the earth, so are Your thoughts and Your plans higher than my thoughts and my plans. Teach me to be obedient to You. Let it be to me according to your Word. 
<br><br>
Teach me Your ways, O Lord, that I may live according to Your truth! Grant me purity of heart, so that I may honor You. 
Father, I pray in the Mighty Name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
