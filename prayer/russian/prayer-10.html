              <p align="justify">Lord, my heart is troubled. I do not have peace. I try to distract my mind but disturbing thoughts keep coming. Lord Jesus, You have promised Your peace to all Your children. You said, “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” <br><br>
Lord Jesus, I believe in Your promise. I believe in You. Thank You, Lord, for being there with me. I praise Your Holy Name. I surrender all my worries to You as You care for me. And I believe that Your peace is upon me. Your peace is working in me. Your peace surpasses all human understanding. Thank You, Lord. 
Lord, I know that You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in You and all whose thoughts are fixed on You. I trust in You, Lord. You are the eternal Rock and our everlasting strength. I will lie down in peace and sleep, for You alone, O Lord, will keep me safe. <br><br>
I also pray for all Your children who do not have peace in their hearts. May Your peace touch their hearts and comfort them too. Father, I ask this prayer in the Mighty Name of Jesus. Amen. </p>
