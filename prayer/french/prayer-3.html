              <p align="justify">We, who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, <br>
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. <br>
I will say of the Lord, “You are my refuge and my fortress; <br>
My God, in You I will trust.” <br>
Surely You shall deliver us from the snare of the fowler <br>
And from the perilous pestilence. <br>
You shall cover us with Your feathers, <br>
And under Your wings we shall take refuge; <br>
Your truth shall be our shield and buckler. <br>
We shall not be afraid of the terror by night, <br>
Nor of the arrow that flies by day, <br>
Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, <br>
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. <br>
A thousand may fall at our side, <br>
And ten thousand at our right hand; <br>
But it shall not come near us. <br>
Only with our eyes shall we look, <br>
And see the reward of the wicked. <br>
Because we have made You Lord, who is our refuge, <br>
Even the Most High, our dwelling place, <br>
No evil shall befall us, <br>
Nor shall any plague come near our dwelling; <br>
For You shall give Your angels charge over us, <br>
To keep us in all your ways. <br>
In their hands they shall bear us up, <br>
Lest we dash our foot against a stone. <br>
We shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, <br>
The young lion and the serpent we shall trample underfoot. <br>
“Because we have set our love upon You, therefore You will deliver us; <br>
You will set us on high, because we have known Your name. <br>
We shall call upon You, and You will answer us; <br>
You will be with us in trouble; <br>
You will deliver us and honor us. <br>
With long life You will satisfy us, <br>
And show us Your salvation.” </p>
