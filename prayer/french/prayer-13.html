Lord, I am Your child and I am led by the Holy Spirit. I have nothing to fear. The Holy Spirit joins with my spirit to affirm that I am Your child. <br><br>
Lord, You are in charge and in control of everything. I have nothing to fear as You are my Abba, Father. <br><br>
Thank You, Father Lord. Please continue to bless me with Your peace. And Father, I pray for others who are also in need of Your mercy and grace in overcoming fears. Father, I pray in the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>
